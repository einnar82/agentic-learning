# WORKING_SESSION.md (Template)

> Purpose: reusable session template for day-to-day learning and implementation.
> Usage: copy this file to `docs/sessions/YYYY-MM-DD.md` at session start, then fill only required fields by default.
> Workflow reference: follow `docs/WORKFLOW.md` for the complete operating sequence.
> This template changes infrequently; per-session logs live in `docs/sessions/`.
> Last update (2026-02-08): split session history into `docs/sessions/` and keep this file template-only.
